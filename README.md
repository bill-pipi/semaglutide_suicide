**Figure 1.**  Comparison of the incident (first-time experience of ) suicidal ideations in the study population with overweight or obesity and no prior history of suicidal ideations (prior to the index event of first prescription of semaglutide or non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications that occurred from June 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022) between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications groups  and within a 6-month time window after the index event. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 6-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied.


**Figure 2a.**  Comparison of recurrent experience of suicidal ideations and (b) medication prescriptions for suicidal ideation treatments in the study population with overweight or obesity and a prior history of suicidal ideations (prior to the index event of first prescription of semaglutide vs non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications that occurred from June 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022) between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications groups within a 6-month time window after the index event. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 6-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied.


**Figure 2b.**  Comparison of medication prescriptions for suicidal ideation treatments in the study population with overweight or obesity and a prior history of suicidal ideations (prior to the index event of first prescription of semaglutide vs non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications that occurred from June 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022) between propensity-score matched Semaglutide group  and the non-GLP1R agonist anti-obesity medications group  within a 6-month time window after the index event. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 6-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied.


**Figure 3.**  Comparison of incident (first-time experience of ) suicidal ideations in the study population with T2DM and no history of suicidal ideations prior to the index event of first prescription of semaglutide or other non-GLP-1 anti-diabetic medications that occurred during December 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-diabetic medications groups within 6-month time window after the index event. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 6-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied.

**Figure 4.**  Comparison of the incident and recurrent suicidal ideations in the study population with T2DM between propensity-score matched Semaglutide and non-GLP1R agonist anti-diabetic medications groups at different follow-up time windows (up to 3 years). Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the 6-month time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied.

Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied.
